        <h2>The Gloom of School</h2>
        <p>This is a simple haiku about how much homework I have and how overwhelmed I am:<br></p>
        <div id="poem">
        <p>
        Papers pile sky-high,<br>
        Deadlines loom like stormy clouds,<br>
        Sleep's a distant dream.
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>
          My main interest is baseball. MLB, college, little league, you name it. I played from a very young age, probably around 5 y/o until I was a freshman in college. Baseball was
        always such a calming experience for me, it was the best thing in the world to me. Playing in college was the best expereince ever, that level of play humbles you and teaches you lessons, 
        but I'm so glad I was able to participate in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love fashion. I'm not quite into designing and highend fashion, although I have friends that are in fashion school and they're some of the coolest people I've met.
        My interest in style includes clothes on the more modest end. I love to thrift for clothes, I actually think aboutt 99% of the clothes in my closet are thirfted. I don't remember
        the last time I bought an article of clothing from an actual brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another interest of mine is computers. Obviously, being a computer science major, I have an interest in coding and stuff alike. But, playing games on computers as well as building computers
          is a big interest of mine. I built my own PC in order to be able to game as well as do my homework and such on it. My older brother, who built his own PC as well as one for my little brother,
          helped me build mine. It's an absolute beast of a machine and does everything I need and more.
